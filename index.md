Hi! I'm Carter, a sophomore at the University of Washington studying CS!

This blog is meant to record my various learnings, scattered ideas, and
(hopefully) explaining concepts that I found difficult when starting with ML!
Feel free to get in touch with me using my contact info in the footer!

I'm also looking for intern/research opportunities for the Summer 2023. Reach
out to me if you have any leads!
